A thalamo-cortico-thalamic neural mass model to study alpha rhythms in
Alzheimer's disease

To execute the model:
1) Open the .mdl file in Matlab.
2) Make sure the *.m files are in the same folder as the .mdl file.
3) Run the model by clicking on the 'Play' button on the Simulink
window.



This model is based on:
