A thalamo-cortico-thalamic neural mass model to study alpha rhythms in
Alzheimer's disease

To execute the model:

1) Clone the repository on your computer (press on green button "Clone or download" -> "Download Zip")

2) Unzip the folder and open the "SimulinkModels" folder. Any *.mdl file represents and Simulink model for a particular scenario.


3) Open the "basab_thalamocorticothalamicCkt.mdl" which represents the baseline for healthy individuals (the file should open Simulink).

3) Run the model by clicking on the 'Play' button on the Simulink
window. You will notice variables appear in your Matlab workspace; they represent the model output.


To obtain the plots from the model:

1) open the main.m file and run the script; it will use data from runs that were simulated on my computer to do the plots.
